nmap report:

PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.52 ((Win64) OpenSSL/1.1.1m PHP/8.1.1)

|_http-title: Site doesn't have a title (text/html; charset=UTF-8).
Warning: OSScan results may be unreliable because we could not find at least 1 open and 1 closed port
OS fingerprint not ideal because: Missing a closed TCP port so results incomplete

-----------------------
hint: when i made an nmap report i found that open port which is 80/tcp and this mean that we gonna deal with website.

http://unika.htb/

echo "10.129.118.94 unika.htb" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts

we should add this fucken script to /etc/hosts

this is tha zatona :

File Inclusion Vulnerability
Dynamic websites include HTML pages on the fly using information from the HTTP request to include GET
and POST parameters, cookies, and other variables. It is common for a page to "include" another page
based on some of these parameters.
 LFI or Local File Inclusion occurs when an attacker is able to get a website to include a file that was not
intended to be an option for this application. A common example is when an application uses the path to a
file as input. If the application treats this input as trusted, and the required sanitary checks are not
performed on this input, then the attacker can exploit it by using the ../ string in the inputted file name
and eventually view sensitive files in the local file system. In some limited cases, an LFI can lead to code
execution as well.
 RFI or Remote File Inclusion is similar to LFI but in this case it is possible for an attacker to load a remote
file on the host using protocols like HTTP, FTP etc.
We test the page parameter to see if we can include files on the target system in the server response. We
will test with some commonly known files that will have the same name across networks, Windows
domains, and systems which can be found here. One of the most common files that a penetration tester
might attempt to access on a Windows machine to verify LFI is the hosts file,
WINDOWS\System32\drivers\etc\hosts (this file aids in the local translation of host names to IP
addresses). The ../ string is used to traverse back a directory, one at a time. Thus multiple ../ strings are
included in the URL so that the file handler on the server traverses back to the base directory i.e. C:\ .
